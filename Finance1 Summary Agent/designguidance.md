## 🎯 Design Philosophy: "Calm & Trustworthy"
The goal is to reduce "financial anxiety" by using clean layouts, plenty of white space, and professional colors.

## 🎨 Color Palette
- **Primary (Stability):** Deep Slate Blue (#1E293B) - Use for headers, primary buttons, and branding.
- **Secondary (Cleanliness):** Crisp White (#FFFFFF) / Light Cloud Gray (#F8FAFC) - Use for backgrounds.
- **Accent (Growth):** Emerald Green (#10B981) - Use for positive trends, "Success" states, and "Deposit" actions.
- **Alert (Attention):** Soft Terracotta (#EF4444) - Use sparingly for errors or critical warnings.

## ✍️ Typography & Tone
- **Font:** Use a clean, modern Sans-Serif (like Inter or Geist).
- **Language:** Avoid heavy jargon. Use "Plain Language" (e.g., "Transfer Money" instead of "Initiate ACH Transaction").

## 📱 Layout Rules
- **Dashboard First:** Key data (Balance, Recent Activity) must be visible without scrolling.
- **Mobile Responsive:** All designs must work perfectly on touch-screens.
